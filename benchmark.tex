\subsection{lmapper}
We benchmarked lmapper against Kepler Mapper, obtaining the following results:

\textbf{Hardware}:
MacBookPro

\paragraph{conclusions}
We see that the package filterutils.cpp managed to get an almost perfect speedup, almost linear with the number of threads launched.
The pure Python implementation obtained a slowdown of 10\% compared to Kepler Mapper.  
\subsection{predmap}
we managed to obtain the same results of Francesco Palma's mather thesis
